             <p><strong>Sarah Jacobs</strong> Founder & Manager of Coastal Bean. Sarah started the caf√© with a
             dream of bringing people together over good coffee and fresh food.</p>
             
             <p>Coastal Bean was founded in 2010 in the heart of Durban. From the beginning, our goal has been
        to create a warm, welcoming space where friends and family can enjoy exceptional coffee and fresh, 
        delicious food. We believe in using only the finest ingredients and supporting local suppliers.
        Over the years, Coastal Bean has grown into a beloved family restaurant where kids, parents, and grandparents
        can all feel at home. Tourists visiting Durban also enjoy Coastal Bean for its relaxed seaside atmosphere, 
        local cuisine, and friendly service.</p>

        from nearby suppliers and hosting events that showcase local talent, including musicians and bands.</p>
