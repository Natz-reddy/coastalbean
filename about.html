<h2>Our Story</h2>
<img src="img/inside.jpg"width="1330" height="400"/>
    <p>
        Coastal Bean was founded in 2010 in the heart of Durban. From the beginning, our goal has been
        to create a warm, welcoming space where friends and family can enjoy exceptional coffee and fresh, 
        delicious food. We believe in using only the finest ingredients and supporting local suppliers.
        Over the years, Coastal Bean has grown into a beloved family restaurant where kids, parents, and grandparents
        can all feel at home. Tourists visiting Durban also enjoy Coastal Bean for its relaxed seaside atmosphere, 
        local cuisine, and friendly service.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
       Our mission is to provide a cozy, friendly environment where everyone feels at home. 
        We aim to make every visit a memorable experience, whether you're grabbing a quick coffee, sharing a family meal, 
        or enjoying an evening with friends. Coastal Bean actively supports the local community by sourcing ingredients 
        from nearby suppliers and hosting events that showcase local talent, including musicians and bands.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
     We envision Coastal Bean as the go-to spot for the community and tourists to connect, relax, and enjoy quality meals.
        Sustainability and community engagement are at the heart of everything we do. By supporting local artists, 
        promoting family-friendly events, and partnering with community organizations, we aim to create a positive 
        impact on Durban's social and cultural life.
