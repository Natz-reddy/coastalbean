I worked more on the design side of the website.
Added a consistent navigation bar across all pages.
Applied CSS for layout, spacing, fonts, and colors to create a clean, modern look.
Implemented a hero image on the home page with a welcome message and slogan.
Styled the menu page with images, item names, and prices displayed neatly.

# Improved Navigation
Ensured links are horizontally aligned and easy to access.
Navigation stays visible at the top for user-friendly browsing

# Content and Structure
Organized content on each page with proper headings and sections.
Added placeholders for upcoming features like newsletters and social media integration.

Verified that all navigation links work correctly.
Inspected and adjusted the design to work on different screen sizes (basic resizing checks).
Fixed layout issues with stacking links by applying CSS flexbox.

# Now the site looks more polished and matches the goals of showing off the cafe, menu, events and contact info.
